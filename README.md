### For a slightly more sophisticated experience, check out https://www.charwars.net/games/ to try out games with a little better sound experience and you can also subscribe to see new games.  You can print high score certificates and compete with your friends (or enemies).

#### Coming soon: a more formal 2d Video Game Class and Character class.  They are already present in the games themselves, but I intend to do a little refactoring and documenting with the focus on the GUI class, character class, and sound functions, rather than the game itself.
