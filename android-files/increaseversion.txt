This error occurs because, as the error message suggests, you're trying to deploy an app with a versionCode that has already been used to deploy the same app. To fix this:

In your Android project's build.gradle file, remove the lines that set the versionCode and versionName located under the default config:

/////////////I did this increased to 2.0 etc
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    versionCode 1
    versionName "1.0"
    ...
  }
}
///////////////////////
In the AndroidManifest.xml file, add those definitions:

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0">
